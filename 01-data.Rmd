* Taxa of interest are based on [Description and allergenic potential of 11 most important pollen taxa in the CUSSC region ranked by percent abundance relative to the sum of all pollen taxa over 31 NAB stations that meet inclusion criteria, 2003â€“2017] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10453-019-09601-2/tables/2)
* Spring- and fall-flowering elms are treated separately as suggested by Allison and Yingxiao.
* I decide to separate grasses into early and late-flowering groups as well because many cities have two pollen peaks.

# Data
## NAB data
### Read and clean data
```{r, eval=FALSE}

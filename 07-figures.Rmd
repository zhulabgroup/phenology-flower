## Methodology
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=16, fig.height=16, fig.cap="Approach for detecting pollen phenology from remotely-sensed leafing phenology. Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series of individual trees are used to determine green-up/down days at various green-up/down thresholds. The green-up/down days were then summarized to the site level as green-up/down frequencies. The green-up/down frequencies were compared with time series of pollen count (squareroot-transformed). For each taxa and across all sites, the green-up/down threshold that lead to the best match in the shapes of leafing and pollen phenology curves was chosen. For each site specifically, the best lag between leafing and pollen phenology curves were chosen."}

## Data
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=12, fig.cap="Pollen count and plant occurrence data. (A) Map of pollen counting stations associated with the National Allergy Bureau (NAB) and plant records near selected pollen counting stations. All pollen counting stations are marked in crossed circles, with ten selected stations in this study highlighted in red. Plant occurrence data from street tree inventory, land cover classification, and crowdsourcing are marked in blue points. (B) Pollen phenology of eleven key pollen-producing taxa in ten selected stations. (C) Spatial distribution of pollen-producing plants at ten study sites. Basemap show streets in cities. For simplicity, random 200 plants are visualized for each site."}

## NEON
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.cap="Individual phenological observations extracted from PlanetScope (PS) and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) for wind-pollinated taxa. (A) Correlation between leafing and flowering phenology in NEON observations. (B) Correlation between 50% green-up time from PS and flowering time from NEON. (C) Correlation between 50% green-up time from PS in 2018 and 2019. Different colors indicate NEON sites."}

## Detroit
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Correlation between leafing and flowering phenology on the individual level. (A) Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (green points) are used to calculate the green-up days at different thresholds (red lines), compared with flower observations for selected oak trees in Detroit, crowdsourced flower observations, and pollen count. (B) Correlation between green-up days and observed flowering days (first day exceeding 95% flowering) for different green-up thresholds. (C) Correlation between 50% green-up days in five years and observed flowering days (first day exceeding 95% flowering) in 2017."}

## All cities and taxa
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Comparing pollen phenology from remote sensing and aerial sampling. Pollen phenology inferred from remotely-sensed leafing phenology tuned to the optimal green-up/down thresholds and leafing-pollen lags are shown in lines. Pollen phenology from airborne pollen concentration (squareroot-transformed) are shown in points. Pollen phenology from both data sources was converted to frequency density within each site year for comparison."}

## Climate

(A) Relationship between leafing-pollen phenology lag (day) and mean annual temperature (MAT) (Â°C) for each taxa. (B) Slope of linear regression, with taxa separated into early- and late- flowering groups."}

## Validation

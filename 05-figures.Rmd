## Methodology
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=16, fig.height=16, fig.cap="Approach for detecting pollen phenology from remotely-sensed leafing phenology. Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series of individual trees are used to determine green-up/down days at various green-up/down thresholds. The green-up/down days were then summarized to the site level as green-up/down frequencies. The green-up/down frequencies were compared with time series of pollen count (squareroot-transformed). For each taxa and across all sites, the green-up/down threshold that lead to the best match in the shapes of leafing and pollen phenology curves was chosen. For each site specifically, the best lag between leafing and pollen phenology curves were chosen."}

## Data
```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.width=16, fig.height=16, fig.cap="Pollen count and plant occurrence data. (A) Map of pollen counting stations associated with the National Allergy Bureau (NAB) and plant records near selected pollen counting stations. All pollen counting stations are marked in crossed circles, with ten selected stations in this study highlighted in red. Plant occurrence data from street tree inventory, land cover classification, and crowdsourcing are marked in blue points. (B) Pollen phenology of eleven key pollen-producing taxa in ten selected stations. (C) Spatial distribution of pollen-producing plants at ten study sites. Basemap show streets in cities. For simplicity, random 200 plants are visualized for each site."}

## Detroit

(A) Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (green points) are used to calculate the green-up days at different thresholds (red lines), compared with flower observations for selected oak trees in Detroit, crowdsourced flower observations, and pollen count. (B) Correlation between green-up days and observed flowering days (first day exceeding 95% flowering) for different green-up thresholds. (C) Correlation between 50% green-up days in five years and observed flowering days (first day exceeding 95% flowering) in 2017."}

## All cities and taxa

Leafing phenology tuned to the best green-up/down thresholds and leafing-polen lags are shown in blue lines. Pollen count (squareroot-transformed) are shown in red points. Median of enhanced vegetation in dex (EVI) in the site are shown in green dots. All data are standardized to be between 0 and 1."}

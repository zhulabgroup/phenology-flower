# Infer relationship between leaf-flower lag with climate

Plot correlation between mean annual temperature (MAT) and lag between green-up/down frequency and pollen count.
* A positive lag means leafing phenology leads pollen phenology; a negative lag means leafing phenology lags pollen phenology.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
source("code/clim_plot.R")
p_lag_clim
```

Linear regression to check significance of the correlation. When looking at individual taxa, only Quercus was statistically significant.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
source("code/clim_reg.R")
p_slope
```

Linear mixed-effect model with random slope and random intercept to summarize correlation for early-flowering taxa.
* At warmer places, pollen tend to percede leafing and vice versa.
* This effect was statistically significant overall.
